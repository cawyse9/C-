## Background

## Objective
The aim of this project is to generate efficient functions for calculating moving average of period k across a vector using a C++ function that is callable from R and to benchmark this function against the orginal R-function, and apply it to investigate the changes in climate temperature over the last century.

## Data and Analysis
The data are temperatures represented by the Global Land-Ocean Temperature Index, from 1880 to 2019 (https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/
global-temperature/).
